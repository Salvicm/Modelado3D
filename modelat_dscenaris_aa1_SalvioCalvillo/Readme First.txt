I made the scene in Unity. You need to create a 3D project and just put the files inside the folder(Unity Assets Files) into the Assets folder.
Once done, open the scene and it should show correctly.
In the Work folder there's everything that is done for the objects(.max, textures, .uvw and ambient occlusion maps)
